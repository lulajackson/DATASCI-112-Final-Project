This project, for Stanford's DATASCI 112: Data Science Principles class, takes a deeper look at what makes movies successful. 
The project includes data visualisation, data cleaning, and machine learning techniques. The colab uses multiple scikit-learn models to test what combination
of features and models works the best to predict the box office earnings of movies.
